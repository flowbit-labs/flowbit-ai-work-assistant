# Flowbit AI Work Assistant (Flowbit Labs)

A minimal, practical AI assistant you can run locally to:
- plan your day (prioritize + time blocks)
- rewrite text (emails/messages/paragraphs)
- close your day (review + carryover plan)

This repo is designed to be easy to understand and easy to extend.

## Demo (What it does)
**Plan my day**
- turns your task dump into Must/Should/Could
- creates a realistic schedule
- gives first steps for top priorities

**Rewrite text**
- makes writing clearer, shorter, and more professional

**End-of-day review**
- summarizes the day
- carries tasks forward
- creates a simple first-30-min plan for tomorrow
